## Motivation
Prior to becoming a data analyst I worked helping people financially as a consultant. Financial education is something Iâ€™m really passionate about, as understanding how investing and mitigating debt can really alleviate suffering. My interest in the medical field, inspired by my mother's career as a nurse, has driven me to seek ways to contribute outside of the clinical environment. This project embodies my ambition to intersect medical and financial support, aiming to provide insights that can aid in both realms.

## Data Question
The primary question I sought to answer is this: Is there a correlation between income and vaccination status in America, and if so, what does it show?

This question seeks to understand if and how financial well-being influences healthcare decisions, particularly vaccination uptake. Insights derived could inform policy decisions, healthcare education programs, and financial advising strategies, particularly in underserved communities. 

The intended audience includes healthcare professionals, policy makers, financial advisors, and public health researchers.

## Research and Findings
After compiling data from the CDC and Census, I first explored the data using Excel.
Pivot tables were very helpful in identifying distributions of income and vaccinations. 
I used find and replace to fix errors in symbol transfer with the symbol ">" (greater than), changing the displayed symbols to instead say "or older" after the provided age.
Later, I sorted the data by State to manually add in state fips codes after needing to expand my research further.
After becoming better aquainted with the data, I created three python notebooks. The first objective was to join the data so that correlations could (hopefully) be drawn between the data sets. In order to have a comon key to join on, I used python to pull the last 5 fips numbers from the geography column of the income data. The vaccine data came with fips numbers provided.

After joining the two data sets and looking at different correlations, I found that there was not a clear correlation between income and vaccination rate alone. At this point I decided to expand my research further into looking for correlations in locations as well. 

I imported the data into Power BI to map the income and vaccination rates by state. Here is where I found a clear correlation when looking at the top and bottom income and vaccination rate states:

States with higher incomes frequently have lower vaccinations rates. The opposite is also true with states having lower incomes frequently having higher vaccination rates. Only one state, Arkansas, had both lower income and lower vaccination rates. There were no states in the higher incomes that had higher vaccination rates.


It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and the observed relationship between income and vaccination rates is likely influenced by a combination of these factors. Addressing disparities in vaccination rates requires a multifaceted approach that considers socioeconomic, cultural, and systemic factors to ensure equitable access to vaccines for all communities.


After the analysis was complete I spent a significant amount of my free time theorizing as to what could cause this unexpected correlation. A few of my theories include:

1) Access to Healthcare - I wonder if people in an higher income situation have better access to healthcare services. My husband is and engineer and his employeer very heavily advocates for priortizing health. They offer vaccinations in the office at various times during the year. On the other hand, I know many lower income areas struggle with transportation. Also, if they work during normal doctor hours, and vaccines aren't offered in their workplace, offices may be closed when they get off. Some vaccines also may not be covered by their insurance, or may have additional barries for approval through insurance.

2) Trust and cultural beliefs - Higher-income individuals may have greater trust in healthcare providers and public health authorities, leading to higher vaccination rates. In contrast, lower-income individuals, especially those from marginalized communities, may have historical mistrust of healthcare systems due to past discrimination or systemic inequalities. Cultural beliefs, social norms, and peer influence can shape vaccination attitudes and behaviors within communities. Higher-income communities may have different cultural norms regarding healthcare-seeking behavior and disease prevention compared to lower-income communities.



## Challenges and Further Research
when using data from two different sources, it is common for the data to not have a lot of similarities. The Census data had 133 columns including columns that had already calculated relevant aggregations such as the average income. The CDC dataset only had 10 columns and looked at only 4 different types of vaccines. Because of this, it would be worthwile to look into finding data on additional vaccinations. Also, since we have all gotten the pleasure of experiencing our own pandemic, there was a shift in focus of vaccination data collection in 2020, focusing more on the COVID-19 vaccine, making data on a more broad range of vaccinations even more challenging to find.
